A higher value indicates greater deviation.\n\n**Degrees of freedom:** The degrees of freedom (1,084,460 in this case) reflect the complexity of the test, based on the number of variables and the size of the dataset.\n\n**P-value:** The p-value is a key part of interpreting the test. In this case, the p-value is 1.0, which is extremely high. A p-value near 1 indicates strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, which in this case is that the data is missing completely at random (MCAR).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Since the p-value is 1.0, this suggests that the missing data is very likely to be missing completely at random (MCAR). In other words, the pattern of missingness does not appear to be related to any other variables in the dataset\n*   The chi-square statistic is high, but given the large degrees of freedom, this is not surprising. The test essentially compares observed vs. expected patterns of missingness, and the p-value indicates that any deviations from MCAR are statistically insignificant.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"CrfbhoiLtDgI"}}]}
